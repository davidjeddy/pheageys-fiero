<p align="left"><font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it never end? To makje a loooonnngggg soty short a lady pulled out from an intersection and wasted my sweat Fiero- her insuance has givin me $2600US and some change for what was left ot it. Ok so it wasn't a bad wreck but the Fiero wouldn't drive much more :( O well here's the story if you care: <a href="http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum6/HTML/005271.html" target="_new">Anotherone bits the dust</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortently this means I have to get another vehical, and so far it doesn't look it'll be a Fiero. But when and if I ever get another Fiero I'll update this site about my new Fiero adventures. Till next time...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its not done but what the hell right? Take a look around, tell me what you like, dont like, what you think could be done better, what I could do without and all the bug reports you can file in 24Hrs.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12/11/2k1 - Alright! update time! Not much just some link to other people's Fiero sites (in the 'Stuff' section)and the lastest repair/re-repair.<br>

12/2/2k1&#160;|&#160;Update: I took out the submenu's till I can figure out WTf is with them messing the position up. Also did a lil image compressing for those unlucky 56k souls who wounder in here.<br><br>
