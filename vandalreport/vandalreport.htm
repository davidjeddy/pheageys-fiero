the sudden change? Well it all started out on the evening of the 3<sup>rd</sup>
of November…<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Dj Eddy was hanging out with his friends
when they all decided to go to Orlando to see a movie. Into their car’s they
went, once onto I4 from Rt.27 Dj’s car started acting funny. “At first just the
radio was flickering off then back on. I ignored it at first ‘cause it had
happened before and I thought it was the radio- it being a POS and all.”
Shortly after he explains how his lights would flicker he was losing engine
power. So he flashed his friend and they all pulled over. “I opened the trunk
and the engine was sparking! So I grabbed my fire extinguisher…” By the time
the fire extinguisher was ready, Dj explains, the engine had caught fire! But
it was quickly contained under Dj’s calmness and handling of situation. By that
time is about 8:30-9pm and dark. “I didn’t have a flash light so I decided to
leave it and come back on the morning and fix it. My car has been no stranger
to the side of the road or a flat bed toe truck so I figured ‘what the hell
it’s not like anyone is ganna steal it, its Florida, no-one stops’.” So he
locked his car, jumped in with his friends in their vehicle and continued the
trip.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>We all had a pretty good evening. Saw the
movies, chatted, etc; you know the typical young adult stuff<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Not much after10am Sunday we (My roommate
and I) were ready to go get his car. The only thing stopping him was his keys
were missing. “ I was like ‘O, well, isn’t this convent!’”. I called the movie
theater and couldn’t get a straight answer so my roommate went up to Orlando
from Winter Haven to see them. But of course they did not find them.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I was kind of disappointed. They had four
or five sets of keys but not mine. It’s not like someone else can actually USE
some strangers keys.” Once out of the theater they headed to Dj’s car.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>“We pulled up behind it and I was hoping
maybe I locked them inside. I could get into my car in and emergency if needed.
It would have been detrimental to the car but I could get in.” But they didn’t
need the keys, why? Because someone HAD stopped, not only stopped but they
stole a large amount of Dj’s personal possessions from inside the car. “I have
a good idea how they got in but it upsets me still.” According to estimates the
thief’s stolen over a thousand dollars of merchandise. “…From my Pioneer CD
deck to my POS CD player, to my 8 yrs. of CD’s, my black light, watch, half my
tools, an damp I had gotten from a friend and rebuild from the inside out, and
some other personal effects…”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>So what was your plan from there? No keys
and your car torn up. “I figured I’d put an new ignition into it the next day and
eat the loss. Not easy mind you but I’d have to.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The next day (Monday now) he returns about
1pm and makes his way into his car and spends the next 5 hours try into get a
new ignition in it. “I like working on my car and I didn’t mind the time. I just
kept getting pissed off because someone had done this to me. I don’t take
thing’s like that lightly.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Around 6pm Dj surrendered the battle and
decided to have it towed as soon as he had the funds available.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>It’s to bad he didn’t get it started that
Monday evening.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>“Tuesday I was awakening to the phone. I
answered and it was a friend from Haines City. He says: “ You know there’s no
tires on your car right?”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'>I
respond “Mmm no I didn’t know.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'>Him:
“Well when I passed it this morning I was laying cockeyed on the side of the
road.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'>Me:
“Errrr (getting rather unset and angry). All right, thanks. (Attempting to calm
down).”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>So not only did this guy have his car
break down on I-4 on a Saturday night, he lost his keys, car was broken into
early Sunday morning, AND had his tires stolen Monday! BUT wait there’s more!<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>“I was sitting at work about 2pm Tuesday
and this tow truck guy comes in and asks for me. Turns out the Highway Police
called in an emergency tow because my car was sitting there with no tires. They
traced the plates and tracked me down. So I got stuck with a $115 toe bill on
top of what ever it will cost to replace to keys and ignition. We told them to
bring the car by and we could park it were I was until I figure out what to do
with it. But just like everything else that didn’t work out either. The tow
company did not bring his car by. Wednesday Dj called them and ‘impolite’
reminded them they had what was left of his car. In response the company did
bring by what was left, plus a $160 bill. “As one of my co-workers pointed out
to me ‘they had me by the balls and there was nothing I could do about it.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>What a thing to happen to a guy trying to
save money to get into college and make something of his life.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Dj has since then paid off his loans he
made fro co-workers to get his car back and is planning to get his ‘parts car’
sometime within the next week. Sometimes the harder we try the more things go
wrong until it seems like nothing else could happen. We never imagine it being
this bad.</span></b><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
